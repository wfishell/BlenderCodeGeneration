        <p>
            Many LLMs are not able to take in an mp4 video as an input, so we have created a feedback loop that inputs a kinograph. This 
            enables the LLM to critique its own work from each previous iteration. This loop has three steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the previous iteration's animation and convert it into a kinograph.</li>
            <li>Input the previous animation's kinograph, the penultimate iteration's kinograph, and the original prompt into the LLM and compare which 
                animation better matches the original prompt.</li> 
            <li>Take the better performing animation and input it back into the LLM for feedback. This feedback is used to inform the next iteration's prompt.</li>
        </ol>

                    The animation is cut every 20 frames to create a sequence of images, which is then fed into the LLM. This is the process
                    by which the LLM is able to critique the animation.

<div class="LLM Decision">
    <h2>LLM Decision</h2>
    <p>
        Through this iterative process, the LLM needs to make a choice as to whether the previous iteration's animation was an improvement on the animation before it. 
        This decision prevents the LLM from regressing in quality over time, as we are constantly progressing the best performing animation and its associated code.
    </p>
    <pre>
        LLM Decision on the two previous iterations:
        #Set 2 refers to the the previous iteration's kinograph
        #Set 1 refers to the penultimate iteration's kinograph
        ```Set 2```

        The second set of images offers a clearer representation of a
        ball mid-bounce, showing its elevation above ground and then 
        returning back to the surface, which suggests motion more effectively
        than the first set. In Set 2, there is a more dynamic depiction with 
        visible changes in the ballâ€™s height, supporting the theme of 'balls bouncing'. 
        This set also shows the ball at different heights, which better visualizes the 
        action of bouncing compared to the relatively static positioning in Set 1 where 
        the ball seems to make smaller, less noticeable movements. Set 2 captures the 
        essence of bounce through more apparent vertical motion.

            <p>
                A kinograph is passed through to the LLM and critiqued against the original prompt, and this 
                updated prompt is used to generate the next iteration's code.This example depicts a bouncing 
                ball kinograph and the process of how it is critiqued.

                LLM Feedback on Animation:
                To improve the animation and better fit the prompt, consider increasing the number of 
                balls and introducing varied movement patterns and heights of the bounces to add more 
                dynamism and interest to the animation.
