        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We are using large language models to generate animations in Blender by prompting the LLM to generate code 
            which is used to create the animation. We have developed an iterative pipeline that generates an animation, 
            then passes the finished product back into the LLM. The LLM critiques the animation based on how accurately 
            it represents the inputted prompt and then provides an updated prompt along with the generated code for the 
            next iteration of animation. This process offers clear insights into how LLMs can critique their own work 
            and use that information to improve. It also provides interesting results in how LLMs transition from a prompt 
            to the 3D space, showcasing their ability to handle the complexity of spatial and temporal reasoning in 3D environments.

            <p>
                This initial code template that is fed into the LLM creates an object, camera and light source. 
                This template helps the LLM in initializing code during the first iteration. Having the first iteration 
                generate a proper animation ensures that succesive iterations have a solid foundation to build upon. 

                Prior to including the template code, the LLM was generating animations that didn't have movement, or contained no
                light source, or placed the camera so that it captured none of th animation. This makes it much more difficult for the LLM to generate an
                animation that matches the prompt.

                Since including this template code, we have seen an improvement in the quality of the generated animations. These animations are more closely
                aligned with the prompt, have a lower number of errors, and enable us to to have a standard starting point for each animation which makes results more replicable.
