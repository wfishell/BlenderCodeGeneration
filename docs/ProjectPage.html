    <!-- Analysis Section -->
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>
     This is a simple animation of balls bouncing. The LLM makes key decisions about the speed of how the ball bounces, 
     how it is distorted by the ground, and the complexity of the overall animation which create more realism. While there 
     is still much to be desired from this animation, there is a clear changes in each succesive animation which can be tied back to
     the feedback provided at each instance.
